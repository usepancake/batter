"""Version + engine identity constants for Pancake Engine 0.4.

These constants are written into every result emitted by the runner (PR-1+).
They are also part of `result_hash` — bumping any of them is a deliberate
breaking change to the receipt contract.

0.4.0 adds:
  - MC bootstrap CI for cagr / sharpe / sortino (percentile method, PCG64 RNG)
  - Sign-permutation test for Sharpe null (Good 2005)
  - numpy>=1.26 as hard dependency
  - New warning codes: BOOTSTRAP_INSUFFICIENT, CI_TOO_WIDE, PERMUTATION_P_HIGH
